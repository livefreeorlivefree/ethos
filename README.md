# attempt to be an ethical developer

Act of Programming is Creation. To be a Creator is to be a bit like a God. And it's hard to be a God. To help myself and others I'm (we're) writing these lines in which I (we) (chaotically) attempt to find the _ethos_ of a developer. Pull requests are welcome as are discussions.

## I will 
* write software both to keep the basic needs (shelter, food) fulfilled and for betterment of self and community
* write software that will decrease the amount of suffering in the world, even if ever so slightly
* write software that does what it says in the description, nothing more, nothing less
* write software that supports freedom, equality and openness
* consider the consequences of all of my actions
* make knowledge available for those who seek it
* defend my truths and ideals
* accept reasonable argumentation and change my truths and ideals according to them
* perceive the world _as it is_, not as _it should be_
* do as I say, think as I do - my thoughts and actions shall be in line with each other and reality

## I will not
* write software to satisfy my ego (e.g. for fame, recognition and power)
* write software that increases the suffering in the world
* write software which primary purpose is to end or maim life without human intervention (e.g. automated weapons systems)
* write software that will be used to opress, discriminate and exploit other human beings
* shy away from the thoughts of what makes me _ethical_
* let emotions cloud my judgement
* force my truths upon others
* gatekeep or otherwise prevent others from obtaining knowledge
* give in to delusions about the world (e.g. earth is flat!)
* let myself lie to myself and others.
